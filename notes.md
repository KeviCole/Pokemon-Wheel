Notes, adding Gen1 to wheel dependency caused wheel to continue spinning after pokemon is selected (don't hate it tbh)

try 3 grid items of same size within the layout, and putting in a grid container
that has justify content of space-between, and have the first grid the number align to right,
second to center, third to right

steel type doesn't exist in original project folder, so new image isn't exactly same sizing as the others.
