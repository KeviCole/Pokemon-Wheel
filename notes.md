Notes, adding Gen1 to wheel dependency caused wheel to continue spinning after pokemon is selected (don't hate it tbh)

Bug where switching tabs mid wheel spin breaks the spin
(Due to dependency change in wheel)

To Do List
1. Get Evolution Line to work for edge cases
2. Add Pokemon Stat Data
3. Implement Pokemon Filter Via Game
4. Fix Switching Tabs and Spin Error
5. Fix Tab Width on Phone
6. Fix Background Image, doesn't work on full screen
7. Add Move Selection Page on InfoBox
8. Start on PokeFilter
10. Make images interactive using canvas (specifically on pokemon images)
