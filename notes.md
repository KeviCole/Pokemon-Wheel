Notes, adding Gen1 to wheel dependency caused wheel to continue spinning after pokemon is selected (don't hate it tbh)

Bug where switching tabs mid wheel spin breaks the spin
(Due to dependency change in wheel)

To Do List
1. Fix Evolution Line
2. Added Pokemon Stats
3. Implement rest of Pokemon Game PNG's
4. Implement Pokemon Filter Via Game
5. Fix Switching Tabs and Spin Error
